In such cases it's necessary that the leaf elements	 * (which are containing no collection data) and the composite elements (that do	 * contain collection data) implement the same interface and be treated in the same	 * way. For recursive traversal purposes, it's necessary that the interface provides	 * access to an iterator for both composite and leaf elements.</p>	 */	public class NullIterator implements IIterator	{		//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------		// Public Methods		//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------				/**		 * Does nothing and only returns null.
